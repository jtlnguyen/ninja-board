# community-ninja-board

Front end user interface for the Giveback Ninja Program(v1) and a parallel system to replace the former called v2.

## Deployment locally (laptop) / or for DEV purposes

### Local v1 Deployment

#### Setting up the environment variables
```
export TRELLO_API_TOKEN=<your token>
export TRELLO_API_KEY=<your token>
export GITHUB_API_TOKEN=<your token>
export GITLAB_API_TOKEN=<your token>
export GD_CREDENTIALS=<contents of you google drive credentials.json file (escaped & in quotes)>
export GRAPHS_PROXY=<optional: url to an external proxy storage app>
export USERS_LDAP_PROVIDER=<optional: ldap url for user lookup>

```
note: see *Getting your google drive credentials.json file* below for the GD_CREDENTIALS value


#### Starting up the application

Included in the pom is a jetty plugin, so as long as you have maven installed you just run:

```
mvn clean package -DskipTests jetty:run -Djetty.port=8082
```
### Local v2 Deployment

#### Deploy Back-End Services

1. Follow steps in https://github.com/redhat-cop/ninja-board/blob/v2/quarkus/README.MD

#### Deploy Front-End

1. Follow steps in https://github.com/redhat-cop/ninja-board/blob/v2/react/ninja-react/README.md

## Deployment on Openshift

### Deployment Using the OpenShift Applier

The project can be deployed using the [openshift-applier](https://github.com/redhat-cop/openshift-applier).

#### Prerequisites

The following prerequisites must be satisfied:

1. [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/)
2. OpenShift Command Line Interface (CLI)
3. OpenShift environment

### v1 OpenShift Deployment

#### Setting up the deployment config files

**Optional:** If you want to deploy a different github repository (ie, a forked copy of redhat-cop/ninja-board), then update the ansible variable `source_repo` in *.applier/inventory/group_vars/all.yml* or specify it as an extra variable.

Configure the mandatory deployment parameters in *.openshift/applier/params/ninja-board-deployment*
```
github_api_token=<your token>
trello_api_token=<your token>
...
```

Alternatively, you can target each of the environments for deployment by prepending `dev_` or `prod_` before each variable.s

#### Getting your google drive credentials.json file
```
mkdir gdrive_temp
cd gdrive_temp
wget https://github.com/odeke-em/drive/releases/download/v0.3.9/drive_linux
chmod +x drive_linux
./drive_linux init

```
This will output a url you need to visit and sign in, which will return an auth code to enter in the console.
After you've entered the auto code, the credentials are stored in *gdrive_temp/.gd/credentials.json*.

#### Login to OpenShift

Login to OpenShift

```
oc login <openshift url>
```

#### Deployment

Utilize the following steps to deploy the project

1. Clone the repository

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/ninja-board
    ```

2. Change into the project directory and utilize Ansible Galaxy to retrieve required dependencies

    ```
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --roles-path=galaxy
    ```

3. Ensure the variables have been updated in the _ninja-board-deployment_ params file

4. Execute the _openshift-applier_

    ```
    ansible-playbook -i .applier/inventory galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml -e="@.openshift/params/ninja-board-deployment" -e exclude_tags=ldap-rbac,ldap,v2
    ```

Once complete, all of the v1 resources should be available in OpenShift

### v2 OpenShift Deployment

#### Login to OpenShift

Login to OpenShift

```
oc login <openshift url>
```

#### Deployment

Utilize the following steps to deploy the project

1. Clone the repository and checkout v2 branch

    ```
    git clone https://github.com/redhat-cop/ninja-board
    git checkout v2
    ```

2. Change into the project directory and utilize Ansible Galaxy to retrieve required dependencies

    ```
    ansible-galaxy install -r requirements.yml --roles-path=galaxy
    ```

3. Ensure the variables have been updated in the _.applier/inventory/group_vars/all.yml_ ansible params file to the desired values

4. Execute the _openshift-applier_

    ```
    ansible-playbook -i .applier/inventory galaxy/openshift-applier/playbooks/openshift-cluster-seed.yml -e="@.openshift/params/ninja-board-deployment" -e include_tags=v2
    ```

    ***NOTES***
    * If you have not yet created the openshift dev project, you will need to change the `include_tags` argument to `include_tags=project-req-dev,v2`
    * If you have not yet created a Jenkins instance in the openshift dev project, you will need to change the `include_tags` argument to `include_tags=cicd,v2`
    * If you are not behind RedHat Network and would like access to services that use ldap, you will need to change the `include_tags` argument to `include_tags=ldap-rbac,ldap,v2`. This will ***FAIL*** if you do not have sufficient priveleges. If you don't have access to perform this, ask a cluster administrator.

Once complete, all of the v2 resources should be available in OpenShift
